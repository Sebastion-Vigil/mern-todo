### Initial Observations: ###

 #### Unique Highlights: ####
 - react hooks! yay!
 - react-router6+
 - react-query => like jquery? research & learn 2 use with the quickness!
 - vite instead of create-react-app 
 - lodash, pkg o' f() 4 iterating arrs, objs, strs, slicing & dicing! 

 #### Client: ####
  - npm run dev -> start up front end in dev mode
  - no public folder -> index.html just out there
  - using .jsx files, e.g., App.jsx => research this online (pros/cons)
  - main.jsx file replaces traditional (2 me, at least ";-)") index.js file
  - vite -> used instead of create-react-app => research this online (how 2 use, duh!)

 #### Server ####
  - i C .js files, e.g., the good ol' traditional index.js file!
   - research Y set up this way compared to .jsx files, e.g., main.jsx in client

 ##### Idea #####
 - build learn to code website for juveniles, teens, and young adults
 - teach them computer science concepts wrapped around the tangible experience of building a web app
 - make free, engaging, fun
 - break down Time Complexity and Big O Notation using simple experiences/ideas that they can relate to.
   - e.g., Explain Big O Notation and Time Complexity using an analogy of bussing tables in a restaurant
   - Contrast Time Complexity to a speedomoter in a car; a speedometer is a set measure of a car's current speed,
   - whereas Time Complexity measures the efficiency of an algorithm, i.e., how many data points you must hit
   - (use the bussing analogy => say there are 10 tables in your work area, and for each table, you have a set goal, to completely reset the table so that more customores can be sat. )
